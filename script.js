///==============================================//Inclass Lab --Mini Mockup Project -- Using OOP ( Object Oriented programing),loops, and functions.
// Build a game battling alien spaceships using Javascript.
// Earth has been attacked by a horde of aliens! You are the captain of the USS Assembly, on a mission to destroy every last alien ship.

// Battle the aliens as you try to destroy them with your lasers.

// There are six alien ships. The aliens' weakness is that they are too logical and attack one at a time: they will wait to see the outcome of a battle before deploying another alien ship. Your strength is that you have the initiative and get to attack first. However, you do not have targeting lasers and can only attack the aliens in order. After you have destroyed a ship, you have the option to make a hasty retreat.

///***   Round Logic */
// A game round would look like this:

//1. You attack the first alien ship
// If the ship survives, it attacks you
        ////....// If you destroy the ship, you have the option to attack the next ship or to retreat
/// Ans: USS Assembly players --nasa1,nasa2, nasa3, etc and Aliens -- alien1,alien2,alien3 etc

// const generateRandomNum = (min, max) => {
//     let random = Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min) + min);

// min = Math.ceil(min);
//   max = Math.floor(max);
//   return Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1) + min);

   ///////// Pseudo Codes //////////////////
// 1. USS Assembly attacks the first alien ship (Yellow Star).IF Ship survives, it attacks USS Assemble. Esle IF ship destroyed, USS Assembly attacks next ship(Spinning Plate).
// Space arena reads "One Alien Ship Down 5 to go!!
// Then use window.alert ( or alert()method) that pops up "Caution Alien Upfront"

// 2.  USS Assembly attacks the first alien ship (Yellow Star).IF Ship survives, it attacks USS Assemble. USS Assembly survives. USS Assembly attacks second ship( Yellow Stone). Alien ship survives. Alien ship attacks USS Assembly. This attacks continue until all Alien ships are destroyed. Space arena reads "You Won. Earth is Safe!!"



//=============================//

// Ship Properties
//1. hull is the same as hitpoints. If hull reaches 0 or less, the ship is destroyed
//2. firepower is the amount of damage done to the hull of the target with a successful hit
//3. accuracy is the chance between 0 and 1 that the ship will hit its target

//A) Your spaceship, the USS Assembly should have the following properties:

// hull - 20 (hit points)
// firepower - 5 (Amount f damage to the hull)
// accuracy - .7 ( i.e 70% chance of hitx target) (chance between 0 and 1 that ship will hit its target)
   //Thus write a fxn that takes in  an object  with 3 propetries using object Literal and Constructor

    //Object literal

    //  const ussAssembly = {
    //     hull :'20',
    //     firepower: '5',
    //     accuracy: '.7',
    //  }
    // console.log(ussAssembly.accuracy)
     
    //  // //Constructor
    //  const USSAssembly = (hull,firepower,accuracy) => {
    //      this.hull = hull;
    //      this.firepower = firepower;
    //      this.accuracy = .72
    //  }
         // below .7 is a hit while above .7( e.g .71) is a miss
         
        //  if (Math.random() < alienAttacking.accuracy) {
        //      	console.log('You have been hit!');
        //       } else {
        //         console.log('You can attack')
        //       }

//B) The alien ships should each have the following ranged properties determined randomly:using object Literal/Constructor.

// hull - between 3 and 6
// firepower - between 2and 4
// accuracy - between .6and .8

// const alienShip =  {
//     hull : generateRandomNum(3,6)
//     firepower: generateRandomNum(2,4)
//     accuracy: generateRandomNum(6,8)

//  }

//    // //Constructor
//    const alienShips = (hull,firepower,accuracy) => {
//     this.hull = hull;
//     this.firepower = firepower;
//     this.accuracy = .6
// }

// You could be battling six alien ships each with unique values.

// Example use of accuracy to determine a hit:

// if (Math.random() < alien[0].accuracy) {
// 	console.log('You have been hit!');
// }

// if (Math.random() < alienShips[2].accuracy) {
//     console.log('You have been hit!');
//  }





////***** */ ðŸ‘¾ Where to begin? *******//

// Read over the specifications. Make sure you understand them. If you do not understand them, try to clarify them for yourself.
// Plan the game. This is an act of simplification.
// From these programming principles

// Use pseudo code to get a sketch of your game first.
// Avoid Creating a YAGNI (You aren't going to need it) - You should not try to add functionality until you need it.
// Do the simplest thing that could possibly work.
// Often, beginning something is an act of creative inspiration to find the simplest possible case. The first step is not necessarily a matter of logical deduction. Once you have a few 'clues' you can follow the trail of crumbs to a logical conclusion.


//**** */ Actors and then actions ****/
// A good rule of thumb is start with the actors and then the actions. What actors do we need? In this case, we need our spaceship and the alien spaceships. An action these ships can take is to attack something. Perhaps a ship object (an actor) could therefore have an attack method (an action).

// A repeating action in the game is that these ships attack each other until one of them has been destroyed. This might necessitate a loop or multiple loops.




// ðŸ‘¾ Start simpler than the instructions suggest
// Keep these five things in mind when planning and coding your game:

// Begin even simpler than the specifications suggest. In this case, perhaps just start with one alien ship instead of many alien ships, and get the code for one ship working first.
// Root out any 'gotchas' that you really ought to foresee. In this case, will we really want nested loops -- one for a battle, one for iterating over aliens)? How will we exit one loop and then exit the parent loop? Perhaps keeping it to one loop somehow will help us avoid unnecessary difficulties.
// When coding, form a solid and testable foundation before building upon it with more functionality. In this case, is there a bug where an alien can attack after it has been destroyed? Better fix that bug before increasing the complexity of the code.
// When you have a piece of functionality tested and working, commit it. Try not to commit broken code. Unsure of when to commit? Commit when something works. You want to save working code.
